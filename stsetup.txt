How to set up st terminal, so that you don't have to do it every time. 

You clone st 
git clone https://git.suckless.org/st

sudo make clean install

Then you download the patch you  want using wget.

wget https://easntenteaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.scrollble.hsoesatnh

U use the command: patch --merge -i scrollable....0.8.5.diff

then you use again
sudo make clean install 


after that you need to set up the keys for your machine.
i add this one to the static unsigned int s...: 
static unsigned int scrollback = 10000;

then i add these to the shortcuts: 
    { ShiftMask,            XK_Page_Up,     kscrollup,      {.i = -1} },
    { ShiftMask,            XK_Page_Down,   kscrolldown,    {.i = -1} },
    { ShiftMask,            XK_Up,          kscrollup,      {.i = 1} },
    { ShiftMask,            XK_Down,        kscrolldown,    {.i = 1} },


and finally i remap these in the shortcuts, so that i can zoom with cntr + + and cntrl + -
	{ TERMMOD,              XK_plus,        zoom,           {.f = +1} },
	{ ControlMask,          XK_minus,       zoom,           {.f = -1} },
